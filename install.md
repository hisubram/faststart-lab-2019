# Installation and Configuration

## Installation

Install the following softare and create service instances as mentioned below:

1. Install `node.js` by downloading the setup from [https://nodejs.org/en/download](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (Node.js 8.x or above). For more information on installation instructions, refer [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/). Check the node version as shown below:

    ```
    $ node --version
    v8.6.0
    ```
2. Install `Cordova` and verify Cordova version. You can download the package from [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/cli/index.html)

    ```
    $ sudo npm install -g cordova@7.0.1
    $ cordova --version
    7.0.1
    ```
    >**Note**: 
    >* If you are on Windows, instead of using `sudo`, run the above command (and the ones below) in a command prompt opened in administrative mode.
    >* Please refer [MFP documentation](https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/application-development/sdk/cordova/) for compatible versions of Cordova.

3. Install Ionic and check the Ionic version by running the following command.

    ```
    $ sudo npm install -g ionic@3.19.0
    $ ionic --version
    3.19.0
    ```

4. Install IBM Mobile Foundation CLI

    ```
    $ sudo npm install -g mfpdev-cli
    $ mfpdev --version
    8.0.0-2017091111
    ```
    >**Note**: While installing MFP CLI, if you hit an error saying `npm ERR! package.json npm can't find a package.json file in your current directory.`, then it is most likely due to [MFP CLI not being supported in your npm version](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46168090/ibm-mobile-first-mfpdev-cli-installation-failure). In such a case, downgrade your npm as below, and then install MFP CLI.
        ```
        $ sudo npm install -g npm@3.10.10
        ```

5. Install GIT from [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and check the version as shown below:

## Configuration

### Creating a Cloudant database and populating it with sample data

#### Create Cloudant database

* Log in to [IBM Cloud Dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/) with your credentials.
* From the welcome page of Cloudant service that you have created, launch the Cloudant Dashboard.
* In the Cloudant Dashboard, click on `Databases`.
* Click on `Create Database`. Specify name of database as `myward` as shown below. Click `Create`.

    <img src="images/CreateCloudantDatabase.png" alt="Create Database in Cloudant" width="800" border="10" />

    Once the database is created, the dashboard will update to show the documents inside `myward` database (which, as expected, will be empty to begin with).

* Click `Create Document`. Under document content, after the auto populated `_id` field, enter grievance details as shown below. Please note that you need to put a comma (,) after the auto populated `_id` field.

    ```java
    {
      "_id": "7fc63023799dfda9582609e75127b4fa"<b>,
      "reportedBy": "shivahr@gmail.com",
      "reportedDateTime": "20171125_152627",
      "picture": {
        "large": "IMG-20171125-WA0012.jpeg",
        "thumbnail": "thumbnail_IMG-20171125-WA0012.jpg"
      },
      "problemDescription": "Car parking on busy market road chocking movement of other vehicles and pedestrians",
      "geoLocation": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [
          77.7893168,
          13.0773568
        ]
      },
      "address": "Basaveshwara Temple road (behind Market Road), Hosakote, Bangalore 562114"</b>
    }
    ```

* Click `Create Document` to create/save the document.

* Repeat the above steps and create documents for the remaining sample grievances: [SampleData/MyWardGrievance2.json](SampleData/MyWardGrievance2.json), [SampleData/MyWardGrievance3.json](SampleData/MyWardGrievance3.json), [SampleData/MyWardGrievance4.json](SampleData/MyWardGrievance4.json), [SampleData/MyWardGrievance5.json](SampleData/MyWardGrievance5.json), [SampleData/MyWardGrievance6.json](SampleData/MyWardGrievance6.json).

The `myward` database should now list the six documents as shown below under `Table` view.

<img src="images/CloudantDatabasePopulated.png" alt="Cloudant database populated with sample data" width="800" border="10" />


#### Generate Cloudant API Key

* In the Cloudant Dashboard, under `myward` database, click on `Permissions` and then click on `Generate API Key` as shown in the snapshot below.
* Make a note of the Key and Password generated.
* The newly added key would get listed under Cloudant users with default permission of *reader* only. Select the checkbox under *writer* next to the new key to give it write permission as well.

    <img src="images/COS_CreateBucket.png" alt="Create a bucket in IBM Cloud Object Storage" width="800" border="10" />

* The *Bucket overview* page for the newly created bucket will get shown. Click on `Upload` button and then select `Files`. Select transfer type as `Standard Upload` and select all the images under [SampleData](SampleData) directory (the six images and their thumbnails). Click `Open`. Click on `Upload` as shown below. Once upload is complete, you should see the images listed under your bucket.

        <img src="images/IAM_CopyServiceID.png" alt="Copy Service ID from IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management dashboard" width="800" border="10" />

* Add Cloud Object Storage *Writer* role to that service ID
    - Back in *IBM Cloud Object Storage* dashboard, select the newly created `Bucket` under `Buckets`.
    - Click on `Policies`. In the `Service IDs` tab, under `Select a service ID`, select the service ID created in the above step. Under `Select a role to this bucket`, select `Writer`. Click `Create access policy` as shown below. You should get a confirmation dialog saying “Service permission created“.

        <img src="images/COS_CreatePolicyForServiceID.png" alt="Add Writer role to the Service ID in IBM Cloud Object Storage" width="800" border="10" />

* Create an API Key
    - Back in *IBM Cloud Identity & Access Management* dashboard, under `Service IDs`, click on the service ID created earlier.
    - Under `Access policies`, you should see the `Writer` role for your bucket. 
    - Click on `API keys` tab and then click on `Create` button. In the `Create API key` dialog, give a name and description for the API key and click on `Create`. You should get a confirmation dialog saying `API key successfully created` as shown below.
    - Click on `Download` and save the API key as shown below. Note: This is the only time you will see the key. You cannot retrieve it later.
    - Finally click on `Close`.
